# [Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals)

**Offered by**: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

**Instructor**: Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider

**Course Goals and Objectives**:
- Design and implement object-oriented programs in the C++ language, including defining classes that encapsulate data structures and algorithms.
- Analyze the running time and space needs of an algorithm, asymptotically to ensure it is appropriate at scale, including for big data.
- Select and implement appropriate data structures that best utilize resources to solve a computational problem.
- Prepare for advanced courses in CS with the foundational knowledge of object data structures needed to implement and call advanced library functions.

## Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++

**Topics**:
- Write a C++ program, including setting up an interactive development environment, debugging and linking to libraries of helpful pre-existing routines.
- Understand the C++ memory model, including its use of pointers and how memory is allocated and deallocated.
- Implement abstract data structures as C++ classes using constructors, destructors, member functions and operators.
- Engineer C++ software solutions using class hierarchies and templates.

## Ordered Data Structures

**Topics**:
- Orientation and Linear Structures
- Tree Structures
- Advanced Tree Structures
- Heap Structures

## Unordered Data Structures

**Topics**:
- Hashing
- Disjoint Sets
- Graph Data Structures
- Graph Algorithms
