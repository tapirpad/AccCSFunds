# [Accelerated Computer Science Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cs-fundamentals)

Topics covered by this Specialization include basic object-oriented programming, the analysis of asymptotic algorithmic run times, and the implementation of basic data structures including arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, heaps and graphs, as well as algorithms for traversals, rebalancing and shortest paths. This Specialization sequence is designed to help prospective applicants to the flexible and affordable Online Master of Computer Science (MCS) and MCS in Data Science prepare for the Online MCS Entrance Exam. The Online MCS Entrance Exam allows applicants who do not have graded and transcripted prerequisite CS coursework in the areas of data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming to strengthen their applications for admission.

**Offered by**: University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign

**Instructor**: Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider

**Course Goals and Objectives**:
- Design and implement object-oriented programs in the C++ language, including defining classes that encapsulate data structures and algorithms.
- Analyze the running time and space needs of an algorithm, asymptotically to ensure it is appropriate at scale, including for big data.
- Select and implement appropriate data structures that best utilize resources to solve a computational problem.
- Prepare for advanced courses in CS with the foundational knowledge of object data structures needed to implement and call advanced library functions.

## Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++

**Topics**:
- Write a C++ program, including setting up an interactive development environment, debugging and linking to libraries of helpful pre-existing routines.
- Understand the C++ memory model, including its use of pointers and how memory is allocated and deallocated.
- Implement abstract data structures as C++ classes using constructors, destructors, member functions and operators.
- Engineer C++ software solutions using class hierarchies and templates.

## Ordered Data Structures

**Topics**:
- Orientation and Linear Structures
- Tree Structures
- Advanced Tree Structures
- Heap Structures

## Unordered Data Structures

**Topics**:
- Hashing
- Disjoint Sets
- Graph Data Structures
